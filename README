Utilities to write C++ programs:

- WeakPtrs inspired by Chromium's implementation. These allow copying WeakPtrs
  to an object across threads, and test and use from the creation thread.

- A Bind() implementation similar to std::bind() with special handling for
  WeakPtrs: the method is not invoked if the WeakPtr has been invalidated.
  Simpler than std::bind() in that it doesn't support reordering arguments:
  they must be in the callable's order, and whatever isn't bound must be
  supplied at the invocation site.

- An EventLoop that executes tasks serially. Tasks are anything that can be
  assigned to std::function<void()>, including the result of Bind().
  Tasks can also be posted with a delay, or only when a given file descriptor
  is read/write ready.
